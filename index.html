<p> I'm a final-year engineering undergrad student, currently residing in <a href="https://vimeo.com/127613117">New Delhi</a>.</p> 
<p>I am an open-source advocate and enthusiast. My primary interests include web development, Linux administration and cybersecurity. </p>
<p>I enjoy spending time pondering over tough problems, especially in the field of programming. I also believe in the Unix philosophy of doing things <b><i>i.e. write programs that do one thing and do it well.</b></i></p>
